Hello Gabriel! I was struggling quite a bit with this assignment as I had a bit of hard time understanding the material (Also, my wifi at my apartment has been out since last Thursday, so I had limited amount of time to do work.)
I know these are not the best excuses, and I should have spoken to you about it earlier, but I was quite overwhelmed both physically and mentally. I will try to put more effort into my next assignment!
